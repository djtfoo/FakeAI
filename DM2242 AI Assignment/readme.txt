DM2242 ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN GAMES ASSIGNMENT
===================================================

DESCRIPTION

In a robot factory production line, there are machines that produce parts to build robots. The maintenance men repair the machines if they break down. Workers assemble the parts to form up the robot at their own workstations. Sometimes, the people need to have a toilet break.

Completed robots come to life, and start to build ornaments that are to be delivered away. When the robot reaches the end of its lifespan, it shuts down and is brought away by the scrap-man. The scrap-man breaks down the robot into scraps at his station, then the maintenance man delivers the scraps to the machines to refill them.

The Supervisor oversees the events in the factory, and gives orders to increase urgency, or for a staff to temporarily do a different job where help is required.
