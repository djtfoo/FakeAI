===================================================

DESCRIPTION

In a robot factory production line, there are machines that produce parts to build robots. There are 2 production machines in total: the robot parts machine, and the micro-chip machine. The maintenance man repairs the machines if they break down. Workers assemble the parts to form up the robot at their own workstations. Sometimes, the workers need to leave their stations at times to take breaks.
Completed robots come to life, and start to build ornaments that are to be shipped out. When the robot reaches the end of its lifespan, it shuts down and is brought away by the scrap-man. The scrap-man breaks down the robot into scraps at his station, then the maintenance man delivers the scraps to the machines to refill them.
